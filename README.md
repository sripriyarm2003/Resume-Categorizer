# Resume-Categorizer
Classifying resumes manually is very complex process, so this system enables to categorize resumes into specific job roles.
Developed a Python-based application for data preprocessing and machine learning model deployment using TF-IDF vectorization and a classification model. The project involved cleaning and tokenizing text data, vectorizing it using TfidfVectorizer, and implementing a machine learning model to predict outcomes.
**Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, TF-IDF, Pandas, Pickle
